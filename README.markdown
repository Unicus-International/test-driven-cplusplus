# Test Driven C++ – A C++ Tutorial in 12 Movements

## Overview

Test Driven C++ is a tutorial aimed at familiarising the reader with C++ syntax and use, suitable for first-time programmers. It is heavily focused on using the standard library to its fullest extent, and rather than retreading the same path as so many other C++ tutorials, it focuses on writing C++ for clarity and maintainability.

## Structure

The tutorial consists of 12 movements. Each of these movements consist of a main task, each in increasing complexity, as well as optional extra tasks. These extra tasks either extend the result produced in the main task, or are similar but more complicated tasks with new products.

Each movement contains a markdown file describing the new skill the movement is designed to teach, along with the main task; a markdown file describing the extra tasks, and one or more C++ source files containing stubs for the user of this tutorial to implement.

## Evaluation

As progress is made through the tutorial, the resulting products can be evaluated for correctness. To do so, simply invoke, in the root directory, `make`:

    > make

When done, the resulting program will be run, and you'll be given a quick summary of what you've done so far, what you haven't done, and any problems with what you have done.
