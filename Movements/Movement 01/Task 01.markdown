# Task the First – The Fibonacci Numbers

The Fibonacci numbers is a series of integers, where the first number (F(0)) is 0, the second number (F(1)) is 1, and each following number is the sum of the last two numbers. The first 7 entries in the series are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

The task for the first movement is to implement the function `fibonacci_number` in `movement_01.cpp`, which should for any `n` return the `n`th Fibonacci number.

# Extra Task the First – Generalizing and the Lucas Numbers

The Lucas numbers are related to the Fibonacci numbers, but with the starting point of 2, 1, rather than 0, 1. The first 7 Lucas numbers are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18.

The extra task for the first movement is to implement the function `lucas_number` in `movement_01.cpp`. Since the generators for the Lucas and Fibonacci numbers are the same, try to generalise the functionality and extract any common code into a separate function, using what you learned in Movement 01.
