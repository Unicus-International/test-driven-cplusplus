# Task the Second â€“ Dietary energy converter

Dietary energy is generally measured in one of two units: kJ (kilojoules) or kcal (kilocalories). These two units are related by a factor of 4.184, with 1 kcal equal to 4.184 kJ.

The task for the second movement is to implement a member function in `energy` named `convert()`. `convert()` should return an object of type `energy`, with its value properly converted and its scale set appropriately.
